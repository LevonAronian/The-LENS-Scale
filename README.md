The Logical & Editorial Narrative Scrutiny(LENS) Scale. A comprehensive framework for cinematic evaluation that brings focus to film criticism.

In the modern discourse of film, meaningful critique is too often lost in a sea of reductive scores and unchecked personal bias. The LENS scale was conceived as a correctiveâ€”a comprehensive and all-encompassing standard for cinematic evaluation.
Moving beyond simplistic scores, the LENS scale separates objective artistic merit from subjective personal enjoyment. It offers the most objective rating possible while still honoring the viewer's experience, providing a clearer, more complete picture of a film's worth.

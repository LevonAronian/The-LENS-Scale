# The Logical & Editorial Narrative Scrutiny (LENS) Scale 🎥

## *Le Critique Vérité*

> A comprehensive framework for cinematic evaluation that brings focus to film criticism.

### 🖋️ Philosophy

In the modern discourse of film, meaningful critique is too often lost in a sea of reductive scores and unchecked personal bias. The LENS scale was conceived as a corrective—a comprehensive and all-encompassing standard for cinematic evaluation.

### ⚖️ The Methodology

Moving beyond simplistic scores, the LENS scale separates **objective artistic merit** from **subjective personal enjoyment**. It offers the most objective rating possible while still honoring the viewer's experience, providing a clearer, more complete picture of a film's worth.

This is achieved by analyzing two distinct, yet complementary, facets of a film:

*   **🎬 Objective Scrutiny:** Evaluating the technical and artistic components of the medium—narrative integrity, cinematography, direction, performance, and thematic depth.

*   **✨ Subjective Resonance:** Acknowledging and quantifying the viewer's personal connection, emotional response, and ultimate enjoyment.

By viewing a film through these two lenses, we move past the simple question of "Was it good?" and toward a more profound understanding of *why* it succeeded or failed, both as a work of art and as a piece of entertainment.

The Logical & Editorial Narrative Scrutiny (LENS) Scale
Le Critique Vérité
A comprehensive framework for cinematic evaluation that brings focus to film criticism.

Philosophy
In the modern discourse of film, meaningful critique is too often lost in a sea of reductive scores and unchecked personal bias. The LENS scale was conceived as a corrective—a comprehensive and all-encompassing standard for cinematic evaluation.

The Methodology
Moving beyond simplistic scores, the LENS scale is built on a foundational principle: the separation of objective artistic merit from subjective personal enjoyment. It offers the most objective rating possible while still honoring the individual's experience, providing a clearer, more complete picture of a film's worth.

This is achieved by analyzing two distinct, yet complementary, facets of a film:

Objective Scrutiny: Evaluating the technical and artistic components of the medium—narrative integrity, cinematography, direction, performance, and thematic depth.

Subjective Resonance: Acknowledging and quantifying the viewer's personal connection, emotional response, and ultimate enjoyment.

By viewing a film through these two lenses, we move past the simple question of "Was it good?" and toward a more profound understanding of why it succeeded or failed, both as a work of art and as a piece of entertainment.
